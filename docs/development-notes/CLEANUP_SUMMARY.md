# FieldTuner 2.0 Project Cleanup Summary

## Date: October 26, 2025

This document summarizes the cleanup performed on the FieldTuner 2.0 project to improve organization and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Python Cache Files
- Removed all `__pycache__` directories throughout the project
- Removed all `.pyc` compiled Python files
- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent future cache commits

### 2. Organized Documentation
- Created `docs/development-notes/` directory for historical documentation
- Moved development notes to organized location:
  - `ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_V2.md`
  - `BF6_FEATURES_SUMMARY.md`
  - `FEATURE_COMPARISON_V1_VS_V2.md`
  - `V2_FEATURE_RESTORATION_SUMMARY.md`
  - `VALIDATION_V2_VS_V1.md`
  - `PROJECT_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md`
- Added README in development-notes explaining the contents

### 3. Archived Unused Code
- Moved `src/main_v2.py` to `docs/development-notes/` (archived alternative entry point)
- Moved `src/ui/tabs/quick_settings.py` to `docs/development-notes/` (replaced by quick_settings_v2.py)

### 4. Updated .gitignore
- Added explicit Python cache entries to prevent cache files from being committed
- Ensured build artifacts are properly ignored

## Benefits

- **Cleaner Repository**: No cache files cluttering the codebase
- **Better Organization**: Development notes archived and organized
- **Improved Navigation**: Easier to find current, active code
- **Smaller Repository Size**: Removed unnecessary files
- **Professional Appearance**: Clean, organized project structure

## Files Kept in Version Control

### Active Code
- `src/main.py` - Main application entry point
- `src/ui/tabs/quick_settings_v2.py` - Current quick settings tab
- All core modules and utilities

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `docs/INSTALLATION.md` - Installation instructions
- `docs/README.md` - Documentation overview
- `docs/TESTING_LOG_SYSTEM.md` - Testing documentation
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Project structure documentation
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` - Code of conduct
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `LICENSE` - Project license

### Build Configuration
- `build.py` - Build script
- `FieldTuner.spec` - PyInstaller spec
- `pyproject.toml` - Python project configuration
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `requirements-dev.txt` - Development dependencies

### Assets
- `assets/` - All application assets (icons, images, etc.)

### Test Data
- `FT_2.0_BF6_Profile/PROFSAVE_profile` - Test BF6 profile file
- `tests/` - All test files and fixtures

### Releases
- `releases/` - Release executables and notes

## Next Steps

The project is now clean and ready for continued development. Consider:

1. **Git Commit**: Commit the cleanup changes
2. **Test Application**: Verify the application still works correctly
3. **Documentation Review**: Review and update main README if needed
4. **Future Cleanup**: Schedule periodic cleanup to maintain a clean codebase

## Notes

- All archived files are preserved in `docs/development-notes/` for reference
- The application remains fully functional after cleanup
- No active code was removed, only cached and archived files
