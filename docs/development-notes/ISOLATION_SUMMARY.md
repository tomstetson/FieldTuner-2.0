# FieldTuner 2.0 - Development Isolation Summary

## Overview

FieldTuner 2.0 is now configured with **complete development environment isolation** that prevents interference with other projects.

## Isolation Strategy

### 1. Python Virtual Environment ✅

**Location**: `venv/` directory in project root

**Purpose**: 
- Isolated Python interpreter for FieldTuner 2.0 only
- Separate package installation from other projects
- Prevents dependency version conflicts

**Management**:
```powershell
# Activate (before development)
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Deactivate (when done)
deactivate
```

### 2. Isolated AppData Directory ✅

**Location**: `%APPDATA%\FieldTuner\`

**Purpose**:
- All FieldTuner settings, logs, and backups stored separately
- No interference with other projects' data
- Easy cleanup if needed

**Contents**:
```
%APPDATA%/FieldTuner/
├── logs/              # Application logs
├── backups/           # BF6 config backups
├── favorites.json     # User favorites
├── preferences.json   # User preferences
└── app_state.json     # Application state
```

### 3. Project-Specific Test Data ✅

**Locations**:
- `FT_2.0_BF6_Profile/` - Test BF6 profile
- `tests/fixtures/` - Test data files

**Purpose**: FieldTuner test data is completely separate from other projects

## Setup Scripts

### Initial Setup
```powershell
.\setup-venv.ps1          # Create virtual environment
.\configure-isolation.ps1 # Verify isolation settings
```

### Daily Workflow
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # Activate venv
python src/main.py           # Run application
deactivate                    # Deactivate when done
```

## Protection Against Common Issues

### ✅ Dependency Conflicts
- Each project has its own `venv/`
- Different versions of libraries won't conflict
- Easy to maintain specific dependencies per project

### ✅ Process Interference
- FieldTuner uses its own AppData directory
- Force-closing FieldTuner won't affect other projects
- Clean process termination

### ✅ Testing Isolation
- FieldTuner test data in `FT_2.0_BF6_Profile/`
- Other projects' test data unaffected
- Can run tests simultaneously without conflicts

### ✅ Build Artifacts
- Build output in `build/` and `dist/`
- Already in `.gitignore`
- Each project has its own build directories

## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. **Virtual Environment Pattern**
```powershell
# Standard Python isolation
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. **Separate AppData Directories**
```
%APPDATA%/FieldTuner/      # This project
%APPDATA%/ProjectB/        # Other project
%APPDATA%/ProjectC/       # Another project
```

### 3. **Git Ignore Strategy**
- `venv/` - NEVER committed (local development only)
- `__pycache__/` - NEVER committed (Python cache)
- `build/`, `dist/` - NEVER committed (build artifacts)
- Only source code and requirements.txt are committed

### 4. **Environment Activation**
- Always activate before development
- Always deactivate when done
- Prevents accidental global package installation

## Testing Isolation

### Verify Virtual Environment
```powershell
which python  # Should show venv\Scripts\python.exe
```

### Verify AppData
```powershell
ls $env:APPDATA\FieldTuner  # Should only show FieldTuner files
```

### Verify No Conflicts
```powershell
pip list  # Should only show FieldTuner dependencies
```

## Benefits

### For Development
- ✅ Work on multiple projects simultaneously
- ✅ No dependency conflicts between projects
- ✅ Easy to switch between projects
- ✅ Clean testing environment for each project

### For Deployment
- ✅ Clean builds from requirements.txt
- ✅ Reproducible environments
- ✅ Easy CI/CD integration
- ✅ Portable executable independent of development environment

### For Teamwork
- ✅ Each developer has their own venv
- ✅ Consistent environment via requirements.txt
- ✅ No "works on my machine" issues
- ✅ Easy onboarding for new developers
