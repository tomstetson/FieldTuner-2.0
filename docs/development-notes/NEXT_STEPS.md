# FieldTuner 2.0 - Next Steps & Development Roadmap

## 🎯 Current Status

✅ **Completed:**
- Project migrated to new location (`F:\Vibe Projects\FieldTuner 2.0`)
- All hardcoded paths eliminated and centralized
- Development environment isolation configured
- Path configuration system implemented
- Project cleanup completed
- Documentation created

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. **Set Up Development Environment** ⚡ (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Why**: Essential before any development work

**Tasks**:
```powershell
# Run the setup script
.\setup-venv.ps1

# Verify isolation is configured
.\configure-isolation.ps1

# Test the application
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python src/main.py
```

**Expected Outcome**: Working development environment with isolated virtual environment

### 2. **Test Current Application** 🧪 (HIGH PRIORITY)
