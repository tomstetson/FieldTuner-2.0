# FieldTuner 2.0 - Development Best Practices Guide

## Overview

This document explains the best practices FieldTuner 2.0 follows for Windows desktop application development.

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 1. **Test Like Your Customers**
- Customers run: Native Windows
- You test: Native Windows
- Build: Native Windows .exe
- ✅ Accurate representation

### 2. **Keep It Simple**
- Virtual environment (venv) not containers
- Native Windows not Docker
- Standard tools not over-engineering
- ✅ KISS principle

### 3. **Isolate Dependencies**
- Each project has own venv
- Requirements.txt for dependencies
- No global package conflicts
- ✅ Clean development

## 🏗️ Architecture Best Practices

### Project Structure ✅
```
FieldTuner 2.0/
├── venv/              # Isolated Python environment
├── src/               # Source code
├── tests/             # Test files
├── docs/              # Documentation
├── FT_2.0_BF6_Profile/ # Test data
├── requirements.txt    # Dependencies
└── build.py           # Build script
```

**Why this structure?**
- ✅ Standard Python project layout
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Easy to navigate
- ✅ Industry standard

### Virtual Environment ✅
```
venv/  # Isolated Python + dependencies
```

**Why venv not Docker?**
- ✅ Native environment
- ✅ True customer representation
- ✅ Faster development
- ✅ Standard practice
- ✅ Simpler setup

### Dependency Management ✅
```
requirements.txt       # Production dependencies
requirements-dev.txt   # Development dependencies
```

**Why separate files?**
- ✅ Clear production vs dev needs
- ✅ Smaller production builds
- ✅ Easy to manage
- ✅ Version control friendly

### Path Management ✅
```
src/core/path_config.py  # Centralized paths
```

**Why centralize paths?**
- ✅ Easy to update
- ✅ Cross-platform ready
- ✅ Environment variable support
- ✅ DRY principle

## 🔒 Isolation Best Practices

### 1. Virtual Environment Isolation

**What**: Each project has its own `venv/`

**Why**: 
- ✅ No dependency conflicts
- ✅ Clean testing environment
- ✅ Easy to remove/recreate
- ✅ Standard practice

**How**:
```powershell
# Activate before work
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Deactivate when done
deactivate
```

### 2. AppData Isolation

**What**: Each application uses its own AppData subdirectory

**Why**:
- ✅ No data conflicts
- ✅ Easy to clean up
- ✅ Safe to force-close
- ✅ True isolation

**Where**:
```
%APPDATA%/FieldTuner/  # FieldTuner data only
```

### 3. Process Isolation

**What**: FieldTuner runs as separate process

**Why**:
- ✅ Force-close doesn't affect other apps
- ✅ Memory isolation
- ✅ CPU isolation
- ✅ Standard OS behavior

## 📝 Code Quality Best Practices

### 1. Type Hints ✅
```python
def load_config(self, path: Path) -> Dict[str, str]:
    """Load configuration from file."""
    pass
```

**Why**:
- ✅ Better IDE support
- ✅ Catches errors early
- ✅ Self-documenting
- ✅ Standard practice

### 2. Documentation ✅
```python
def save_settings(self, settings: Dict[str, str]) -> bool:
    """
    Save settings to configuration file.
    
    Args:
        settings: Dictionary of setting keys and values
        
    Returns:
        True if successful, False otherwise
    """
    pass
```

**Why**:
- ✅ Easy to understand
- ✅ Knowledge preservation
- ✅ Better teamwork
- ✅ Standard practice

### 3. Error Handling ✅
```python
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except SpecificError as e:
    log_error(f"Failed: {e}")
    return None
```

**Why**:
- ✅ Graceful failures
- ✅ Better debugging
- ✅ User-friendly
- ✅ Standard practice

## 🧪 Testing Best Practices

### 1. Unit Tests ✅
```python
def test_load_config():
    """Test config loading."""
    manager = ConfigManager()
    assert manager.load_config(test_path)
```

**Why**:
- ✅ Catch bugs early
- ✅ Safe refactoring
- ✅ Documentation
- ✅ Standard practice

### 2. Integration Tests ✅
```python
def test_full_workflow():
    """Test complete application workflow."""
    app = MainWindow()
    app.load_settings()
    app.apply_settings()
    app.save_config()
```

**Why**:
- ✅ End-to-end validation
- ✅ Find real bugs
- ✅ Confidence in changes
- ✅ Standard practice

### 3. Test Isolation ✅
```python
# Each test is independent
# Each test has own data
# Each test cleans up after itself
```

**Why**:
- ✅ Reliable tests
- ✅ Can run in any order
- ✅ No side effects
- ✅ Standard practice

## 🚀 Build Best Practices

```
PyInstaller → .exe
```

**Why**:
- ✅ Customer-ready artifact
- ✅ Easy distribution
- ✅ Test exact customer experience
- ✅ Standard practice

### 2. Reproducible Builds ✅
```
requirements.txt → exact dependencies
```

**Why**:
- ✅ Consistent results
- ✅ Easy to rebuild

```

**Why**:
- ✅ Persistent history
- ✅ Easy to review
- ✅ Debug issues
- ✅ Standard practice

### 3. Error Reporting ✅

    # Continue gracefully when possible
```

**Why**:
- ✅ Graceful failures
